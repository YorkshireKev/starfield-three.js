#Three.js (WebGL) experiment#

##Starfield Demo#

Found this old three.js experiment lurking on my hard drive. Much of the code was
probably borrowed from samples and the like (I think I made it sometime in
2012), but I think it's worth keeping as a demonstration of a minimal code
sample. A kind of 'hello world' three js program.
